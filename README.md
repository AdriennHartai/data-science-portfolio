Hi, I’m Adrienn Hartai — a Mathematics graduate currently completing my MSc in Data Science. This portfolio showcases a selection of projects where I’ve applied statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to solve real-world problems.

# 🏠 Exploratory Data Analysis of House Prices

This project investigates a housing price dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between different property features and their sale prices. It focuses on data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and visual exploration. Completed as part of MSc Data Science coursework.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Understand the distribution of house prices and the features that influence them
- **Dataset:** Structured housing price dataset (from coursework)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Focus Areas:** Cleaning, visualization, statistical summary

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- What is the distribution of house prices?
- Which features (e.g. size, number of rooms) are most correlated with price?
- Are there any outliers or patterns in pricing across different categories?

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling: handling missing data and inconsistent values
- Data visualization: histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps
- Statistical summary and interpretation of patterns
- Correlation analysis

## 📊 Sample Visuals

| House Price Distribution | Feature Correlation |
|--------------------------|---------------------|

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Price is strongly associated with square footage and number of rooms
- Outliers (e.g., extremely large or expensive homes) impact averages
- Visualization helps uncover hidden trends better than raw stats alone

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Compare data over multiple years, if available
- Include geospatial features (e.g., location, neighborhood) for deeper analysis
- Build predictive models in a follow-up project
