# Pricing Analysis for a Window Cleaning Business

This project analyzes how job characteristics affect pricing in a real-world window cleaning business. It explores relationships between variables such as property type, size, difficulty, distance, and duration to uncover trends and build predictive models for fair pricing.

## 📊 Objectives

- Explore how job features influence price
- Visualize key patterns using scatter plots and histograms
- Train regression models to predict price based on features
- Identify ways to improve pricing consistency and fairness

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Random Forest & Polynomial Regression

## 📈 Key Insights

- Property type, size, difficulty, and job duration are strong predictors of price
- Visual analysis shows distinct pricing trends by job type
- Regression models provide a framework for estimating price with reasonable accuracy

## 🤖 Models Used

- **Random Forest Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships
- **Polynomial Regression**: Highlights curved trends in data

## 🔍 Example Use Case

The model can assist business owners in quoting accurate prices for new customers by inputting job features into a trained regression model.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add more data to improve model accuracy
- Develop a simple pricing app or dashboard using Streamlit
- Incorporate customer feedback or repeat visit frequency if available
